Spring Instructor Notes:

Note that the use of a @Required annotation on a setter can be used to make setters required dependencies.

If you use predominantly constructor injection, it is possible to create an unresolvable circular dependency scenario. the Spring IoC container detects this circular reference at runtime, and throws a BeanCurrentlyInCreationException. 

Spring sets properties and resolves dependencies as late as possible

The idref element is simply an error-proof way to pass the id (string value - not a reference) of another
bean in the container to a <constructor-arg/> or <property/> element.

The ref element is the final element inside a <constructor-arg/> or <property/> definition
