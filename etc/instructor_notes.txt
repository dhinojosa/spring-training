Spring Instructor Notes:

Note that the use of a @Required annotation on a setter can be used to make setters required dependencies.

If you use predominantly constructor injection, it is possible to create an unresolvable circular dependency scenario. the Spring IoC container detects this circular reference at runtime, and throws a BeanCurrentlyInCreationException. 

Spring sets properties and resolves dependencies as late as possible
